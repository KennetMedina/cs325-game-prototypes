<h2>Organ Retrieval</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Kill the robots and recover the stolen organs.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Organ donor.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
For this prototype I used keyboard input. This is a sidescroller type of game, it is a shooter, and there is loot to pick up.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To feel excited to be the hero who is trying to save the day.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Use the arrows to move and space bar to shoot. Kill the robots and recover the organs they stole.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
For this game I wanted to become more familiar with tilemaps and object collision.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
There is a drop and collect feature, you must kill the robots and collect the organs they drop.
    Feature not yet added: time limit.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is a villain who has an army of robots and likes to cause chaos. He is your nemesis.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You were hired by a hospital to recover the hearts that were stolen by robots. There are people waiting for organ transplants. You must recover all the organs before time runs.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who likes to be the hero.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Aproximately 5 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Since you start at the top of the map, kill the robots at the top and work your way down.
</li>
